Repository for Reading and Writing feeds.yaml.


## Adding feeds

Install packages.

```
git clone git@github.com:umbrella-network/pegasus-feeds.git
npm install
```

Place text files with equity symbols to be added to the feeds.yaml/feeds-5.5.yaml in the /add/ directory. 

The script expects one symbol per line, and they will be added to the yaml files as keys with a "EQ:"-prefix.  

Duplicate keys will be ignored, and a comment including the source file's name will be added above the new entries in the yaml.

Precision of 2, discrepancy of 1 and an initial fetcher of 'PolygonIOPrice', is hard-coded into the main script and can be changed as desired (before compilation).

Use the following run command from within the base directory to compile and run the script: (assumes typescript already installed globally)

```
npm run script:addFeeds
```

Backups of the original yaml files will be created in the backup dir.  Restore to the previous version using the following command:
Note that only the latest version is kept in backup history.

```
npm run script:restoreFeeds
```

To run an example script that will add the symbols from the files in the /add/ directory then restore the yamls, use:

```
npm run script:example
```

This will print the results of the add / restore to the terminal, displaying the changes of the number of keys.
